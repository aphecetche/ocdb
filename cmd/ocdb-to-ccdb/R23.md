For help on the CCDB prototype see [Costin's doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_GM6yY7ejVEIRi1y8Ooc9ongrGgZyCiks6Ca0OAEav8)

Assuming here the local ccdb server has been started (e.g. using the ansible-installed ccdb modulefile) with something like :

```
TOMCAT_PORT=6464 FILE_REPOSITORY_LOCATION=~/alice/ccdb/local-repo/ java -jar ~/alice/ccdb/local.jar
```

and that there is a local copy of a real Run2 OCDB at `~/cernbox/ocdbs/2018/OCDB`. The program `ocdb-to-ccdb` will register files from that (Run2)OCDB into the (Run3) CCDB.
